# About
Hi this is Skye (or Rachel), a curious person who always love to learn something new. This is a place for me to keep all the stuff that I've learned and tinkered with. Wish you enjoy reading through my learning journals, and hope my enthusiasm could get you to learn new stuffs that you've been wishing to!

# Categories Explained
I know, I know, I have hobbies that scatters around literally everywhere. Don't get alarmed, this section is for explaining how should you start looking into my site!

## Skye Codes
This category is for learning journals about me learning to code, doing web and app development. I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and a few PHP along with Python as well, just a few though) during my studies, and I'm trying to do much more with that! I'll do C language one day maybe...

I'm currently working on a workflow tracking app, Clear Flow. Click [here]() to know more about the development progress if you're interested in getting one!
